    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Factor analysis has revealed five distinct patterns in road safety data, each highlighting different aspects of traffic incidents and road conditions. Let's examine each factor in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factor 1: Traffic Control and Junction Safety\n",
    "Key Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Junction control (0.81)\n",
    "- Junction detail (0.65)\n",
    "- Pedestrian crossing human control (0.53)\n",
    "- Carriageway hazards (0.34)\n",
    "\n",
    "This factor emphasises the role of infrastructure in road safety, particularly at junctions and pedestrian crossings. The high loading (statistical correlation) on junction control (0.81) suggests that traffic management systems play a crucial role in this factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factor 2: Environmental and Site-Specific Hazards\n",
    "Key Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pedestrian crossing human control (0.80)\n",
    "- Carriageway hazards (0.59)\n",
    "- Special conditions at site (0.48)\n",
    "\n",
    "This grouping reveals how environmental conditions and local hazards interact. The strong relationship between pedestrian crossings and carriageway hazards suggests important safety considerations at these locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factor 3: Geographic Location\n",
    "Key Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Location easting OSGR (-0.93)\n",
    "- Location northing OSGR (-0.58)\n",
    "\n",
    "The strong negative loadings indicate this factor represents spatial distribution of incidents. The use of Ordnance Survey Grid References (OSGR) helps identify potential geographic patterns in accident occurrence. The negative values suggest an inverse relationship with other factors, potentially indicating areas of lower incident rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factor 4: Accident Severity\n",
    "Key Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accident severity (-0.90)\n",
    "- Enhanced severity collision (0.76)\n",
    "\n",
    "This factor captures the relationship between different measures of accident severity, providing insights into incident classification and impact. The opposing signs of the loadings suggest a complex relationship between these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factor 5: Road Environment\n",
    "Key Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speed limit (0.77)\n",
    "- Urban or rural area (0.61)\n",
    "\n",
    "This factor highlights the connection between speed limits and area classification, suggesting different risk profiles for urban and rural settings. The positive loadings indicate that these variables tend to increase together."

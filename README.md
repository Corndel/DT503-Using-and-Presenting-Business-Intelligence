# E-commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce data using various analytical techniques including descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, providing insights into customer behaviour, sales patterns, and strategies for optimizing business performance.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-commerce-analysis.git
   cd e-commerce-analysis
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv env
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the `ecommerce_analysis.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks/` directory.

4. Run the cells in order to perform the analysis.

## Using GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a complete, configurable dev environment in the cloud. To use this project with GitHub Codespaces:

1. Navigate to the main page of this repository on GitHub.

2. Above the file list, click on the "Code" button.

3. In the dropdown, click on the "Open with Codespaces" option.

4. Click on "New codespace" to create a new Codespace for this repository.

5. Wait for the Codespace to be created and the environment to be set up. This may take a few minutes.

6. Once the Codespace is ready, you'll see a VS Code-like interface in your browser.

7. Open the integrated terminal in the Codespace by selecting **Terminal** from the top menu, then choose **New Terminal**. Alternatively, use the shortcut `Ctrl + `` (backtick).

8. Create a virtual environment in the terminal:

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

9. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   You should see `(venv)` in the terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

10. Install the required packages:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

11. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the `ecommerce_analysis.ipynb` file.

12. You can now run and modify the notebook directly in the Codespace.

Note: Codespaces will automatically save your work. When you're done, you can close the browser tab. Your Codespace will be automatically stopped after a period of inactivity.

## Data Description

The dataset (`ecommerce_data.csv`) contains information about e-commerce transactions, including:

- Customer details (ID, age group, region, lifetime value)
- Order information (date, product details, quantity, revenue)
- Product data (ID, category, price)
- Discount applied
- Web traffic source

## Analysis Techniques

The project employs several analytical techniques:

1. **Descriptive Analytics**: Summarizing historical data to understand past business performance.
2. **Diagnostic Analytics**: Examining relationships between variables to understand why certain patterns occur.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Using machine learning models to forecast future revenue based on historical data.
4. **Prescriptive Analytics**: Providing actionable recommendations based on the insights derived from the analysis.
